SpaceHaste (codenamed Super Puppy Surprise 2 during development) is a 3D, turn-based strategy game written using XNA.

This was a project done my senior year at Texas A&M for a game development class.

This project is a refugee from the closing of Google Code. Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/super-puppy-surprise-2
