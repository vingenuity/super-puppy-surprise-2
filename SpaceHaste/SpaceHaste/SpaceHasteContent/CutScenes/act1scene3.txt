Rebel Pilot:|     Like the only drunk girl at a party,|     the Federation does |     exactly what we want.
Reuber:|     Who the hell is that?
Argent:|     Who are you?|     How do you know our |     comm frequencies?
Rebel Officer:|     Dammit! That channel is only |     for listening, not communication! |     Those federal pigs can hear you!
Rebel Pilot:|     Hmph. Well, hear this!|     You Federal fascists are in|     for a world of hurt,|     now that you've crossed|     us!
Reuber:|     What the hell was that?
Viridis:|     I'm hit!
Ceruleo:|     An Apfel bomb - but that's our new | top-of-the-line technology!
Argent:|     Viridis, status report!
Rebel Officer:|     Oh great, now we have to |     finish them off.
Ceruleo:|     All units, advance!
