Blau:|     Are you sure about this?
Ceruleo:|     Absolutely, Colonel Albid will|     help us.
Albid:|     Captain Blau! You rogue!|     Release Ceruleo, or we will fire!
Ceruleo:|     Sir, no. I brought him here.
Albid:|     You captured him? Well done!
Ceruleo:|     Not quite, sir. We need to|     discuss Apfel Corp.
Albid:|     ...
Ceruleo:|     Sir?
Albid:|     So you know?
Ceruleo:|     Know what?
Albid:|     Attention all units! Captain|     Ceruleo has betrayed the|     Federation and joined forces|     with Captain Blau. |     Captain Ceruleo must be killed|     on sight!
Ceruleo:|     Dammit!
Blau:|     Some plan this was...
Ceruleo:|     Forgive me, friends. All units,|     engage!
