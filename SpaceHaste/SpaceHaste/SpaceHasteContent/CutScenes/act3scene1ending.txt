Blau:|     What now?
Ceruleo:|     Albid has betrayed us to favor the|     Apfel Corporation.
Argnet:|     Sir, that leaves you in charge.
Lieutenant Colonel Ceruleo:|     Yes. |     Argent, I'm promiting you to Major|     to be my chief of staff. You are to stay|     here and coordinate with the Federal|     Government to negotiate with the rebels.
Major Argent:|     Understood. Good luck, Ken.
Ceruleo:|     And promise me, you will fight|     the good fight if I die.
Argent:|     Sir? If you can't, then how can I?
Ceruleo:|     Don't kid yourself, Argent.|     You're a better officer than me|     and a better man. Some day, I will salute you.
Argent:|     I won't give in, sir!
Ceruleo:|     Major Blau?
Major Blau:|     Yeah?
Ceruleo:|     We need to move out against Apfel.
Blau:|     Roger.|     Do you happen to know Katie Door?
Ceruleo:|     The CEO's daughter?
Blau:|     I haven't spoken to her in years,|     but I would trust her to bring peace.
Ceruleo:|     I would too.|     All units move out to Katie Door's outpost.
