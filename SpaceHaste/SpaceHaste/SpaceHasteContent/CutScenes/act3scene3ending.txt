Albid:|     Have we been defeated? I don't|     believe it!
George Door:|     Curse you, Blau!
George Door:|     Curse you, Katie, you traitor! 
George Door:|     Curse you, Ceruleo!
Ceruleo:|     Finally, we can have peace...
After George Door the traitor|     was captured,
 Ceruleo went back to his post,|     where he continued his|     self-promotion. 
Katie restored Apfel to honesty|     and brought an end to the|     conflict. 
Blau went to become a politician|     and good friend to Kenneth|     Ceruleo. He always wanted a|     greater punishment for George |    Door, but Ceruleo demanded he only|     be imprisoned for life. 
He knew George's rotten heart|     was a far worse punishment than|     anything the Federation could|     give. 
Under the leadership of Katie,|     Blau, and Ceruleo, the Federation|     and rebels came to establish a|     long lasting peace.
