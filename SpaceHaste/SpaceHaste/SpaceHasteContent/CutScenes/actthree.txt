	Albid: So it comes to this.
	Ceruleo: Traitor George Door, accomplice Albid, this is Lieutenant Colonel Ceruleo, Commander of the Blue Brigade. You are hereby under arrest for teason.
	Albid: Haha, Ken a Colonel? You could hardly handle being a Captain! 
	CEO George Door: Don't underestimate him, Albid. You couldn't kill him before, even when I sent rebels stright to him.
	Albid: ...
	George Door: Katie, come with me. Neither the federation or the rebels can win this conflict. Only we can. Only a corporation.
	Katie: Never! The federation exists to serve the people, the corporation only serves itself!
	George Door: What a narrow view. Don't you see? Though this civil war, the federation and all of their political opponents are weakened. Only we remain strong. We are the real authority of this nation! We hold the real power!
	Ceruleo: You pathetic man.
	George: So, Katie, this is how it is? No matter. Albid, destory them.
	Albid: Gladly.
	Blau: Ceruleo, just give me the word...
	Ceruleo: ALL UNITS, ENGAGE!!
	
	**battle**
	
	Albid: Is this defeat? I don't believe it!
	George Door: Curse you, Blau! Curse you, Katie, you traitor! Curse you, Ceruleo!
	Ceruleo: Finally, we can have peace...
	
	Epilog: After George Door the traitor was captured, Ceruleo went back to his post, where he kept his self-promotion. Katie restored Apfel to honesty and brought an end to the conflict. Blau went to be a politician and good friend to Kenneth Ceruleo. He always wanted a greater punishment for George Door, but Ceruleo demanded he only be imprisoned for life. He knew George's rotten heart was far worse than anything the Federation could do. Under the leadership of Katie, Blau and Ceruleo, the ferderation and rebels came to establish a long lasting peace.
