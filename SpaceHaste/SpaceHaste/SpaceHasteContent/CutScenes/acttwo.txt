	Intro: LTC Albid was pleased with Captain Ceruleo's performance and sent him on a special mission to destroy Captain Blau, a dangerous renegade rebel. But Ceruleo has another idea...
	Argent: Filthy rebels. Tell us, where is Captain Blau? Surrender and we may be leanient.
	Second Lieutenant Gruen: I will never betray my commander!
	Argent: Red group, Green group, fill into attack formation.
	Ceruleo: Delay that order.
	Argent: Sir?
	Ceruleo: I have a different idea. I need not kill Blau if we can speak with him.
	Argent: You meant to capture the rogue? Ken, that takes a field grade officer.
	Ceruleo: I know.
	Argent: Okay. I trust you, sir.
	Major Ceruleo: So, this is the famed Lieutenant Gruen? I am acting Major Kenneth Ceruleuo.
	Gruen: I won't have words with you fed'ralist scum!
	Ceruleo: I only want to talk with Captain Blau. Perhaps we can bring some understanding to this conflict.
	Gruen: I understand you mean to kill him!
	Ceruleo: If peace is no priority of yours, then your life no priority of mine. All units engage!

	Reuber: Sir, I thought Blau was going to be here.
	Argent: He makes a good point. Sir, there haven't been any transmissions logged but they knew we would be here.
	Reuber: A trator?
	Argent: Only Captain, no, Major Ceruleo and I have access to alter those files.
	Ceruleo: And if you were going to betray me, I'd be dead already. No, there is no trator.
	Argent: Sir, we're intercepted a transmission. Someone is talking to Captain Blau.
	Ceruleo: Well done! All units, move out.

	Captain Blau: Damn. Lieutenant Rot, take care of this for me.
	**Blau leaves
	Second Lieutenant Rot: You're mine now.
	Ceruleo: We'll take care of these guys first.
	
	**Battle**
	
	Argent: He got away.
	Ceruleo: But we're faster. Viridis, more your team to the Sirius System.
	Viridis: Sir?
	Argent: I see. If they see a presence in Sirius, Blau will move else where. Perhaps to the -
	Ceruleo: Yes, to the Misar system. The pin is mighter than the sword and now we can force their next move.
	
Scene 3 -

	Ceruleo: Captain Blau must have landed on the planet. Alright, destory all of his escourts.
	Argent: Beware of the planet. An Apfel Bomb can use it's gravity to travel further. It's not safe.

	Ceruleo: We have things to discuss.
	Blau: I understand.
	Ceruleo: How did you obtain Apfel equipment?
	Blau: What do you mean? The sell it to us.
	Ceruleo: What? How could they? They sell to us?
	Blau: What!? But they give us intellegence. Like what you did to the Beta Centauri System.
	Ceruleo: What? They gave us proof that you attacked that system.
	Blau: Oh, no...
	Ceruleo: Did they sell you our shield frequency?
	Blau: Yes. They always give us intellegence. It's saved our fight a few times now.
	Argent: Sir, does this mean -
	Ceruleo: Yes, the Apfel Corporation has been orcestrating this war. Forgive me, Captain Blau. You are not my enemy.
	Blau: Then nor are you mine.
