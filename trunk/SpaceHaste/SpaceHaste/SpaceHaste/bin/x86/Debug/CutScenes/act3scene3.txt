Albid:|     So it comes to this.
Ceruleo:|     Traitor George Door, accomplice Albid,|     this is Lieutenant Colonel Ceruleo,|     Commander of the Blue Brigade.|     You are under arrest for teason.
Albid:|     Haha, shameless self-promotion, eh?|     And Ken the Colonel at that!|     Ha!|     You could hardly handle being a Captain! 
CEO George Door:|     Don't underestimate him, Albid.|     You couldn't kill him before,|     even when I sent rebels stright to him.
Albid:|     ...
George Door:|     Katie, come with me.|     Neither the federation or the rebels|     can win this conflict. Only we can.|     Only a corporation.
Katie:|     Never! The federation exists to serve |     the people, the corporation only serves itself!
George Door:|     What a narrow view. Don't you see? Though this|     civil war, the federation and all of |     their political opponents are weakened.|     Only we remain strong. We are the real|     authority of this nation!|     We hold the real power!
Katie:|     I'm standing my ground. |     I could never betray the people of the federation!
Ceruleo:|     You pathetic man.
George:|     So, Katie, this is how it is?|     No matter. Albid, destory them.
Albid:|     Gladly.
Blau:|     Ceruleo, just give me the word...
Ceruleo:|     ALL UNITS, ENGAGE!!
