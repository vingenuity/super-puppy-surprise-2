	Ceruleo: ...
	Argent: Are you okay, sir?
	Ceruleo: How did the rebels get our shield frequencies? 
	Ceruleo: Argent, send recue crews. All surviving personel are now prisioners of the Federation.
	Argent: Incoming transmission, sir.
	Albid: Baker 16, this is Willy 16.
	Ceruleo: This is Baker 16.
	Albid: Ken, is everything alright?
	Ceruleo: Yes, sir. We made contact with the enemy. They know our shield frequencies.
	Albid: So they do. Send a sit rep when you can.
	Ceruleo: Roger, sir.
	Albid: Kenneth, is there something on your mind.
	Ceruleo: Yes. I have a bad feeling about this conflict. Every time we come close to finishing the rebels they bounce back like this.
	Albid: Don't think too much of it. Many wars go like this.
	Ceruleo: Yes, sir.
	Albid: Well, good luck. Charlie-Mike. Willy 16-out.
	Argent: Sir, I have that sit-rep.
	Ceruleo: Thanks. Charlie-Mike, right?
	Argent: Yeah, Ken. Continue Mission.
	
Scene 2
	Albid is pleased with Ceruleo's performance and sends him to a vanguard effort to bring the fight to the enemy. Ceruleo fakes a distress call, laying in ambush. He springs the ambush on a rebel ship that responds but the rebels knew of the ambush and counter-ambush Ceruleo.
