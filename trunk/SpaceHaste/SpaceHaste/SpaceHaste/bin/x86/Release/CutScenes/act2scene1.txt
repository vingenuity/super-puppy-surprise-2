LTC Albid was pleased with Captain Ceruleo's|     performance and sent him on a |     special mission to destroy Captain Blau,|     a dangerous renegade rebel. But|     Ceruleo has another idea...
Argent:|     Filthy rebels. Tell us, where is Captain Blau?|     Surrender and we may be leanient.
Second Lieutenant Gruen:|     I will never betray my commander!
Argent:|     Red group, Green group, fill into|     attack formation.
Ceruleo:|     Belay that order.
Argent:|     Sir?
Ceruleo:|     I have a different idea. I need not|     kill Blau if we can speak with him.
Argent:|     You meant to capture the rogue? Ken,|     that takes a field grade officer.
Ceruleo:|     I know.
Argent:|     Okay. I trust you, sir.
Major Ceruleo:|     So, this is the famed Lieutenant Gruen?|     I am acting Major Kenneth Ceruleuo.
Gruen:|     I won't have words with you,|     fed'ralist scum!
Ceruleo:|     I only want to talk with Captain Blau.|     Perhaps we can bring some understanding|     to this conflict.
Gruen:|     I understand you mean to kill him!
Ceruleo:|     If peace is no priority of yours, then|     your life is no priority of mine.|	All units engage!
