Ceruleo:|     ...
Argent:|     Are you okay, sir?
Ceruleo:|     How did the rebels get our shield frequencies? 
Ceruleo:|     Argent, send rescue crews.|     All surviving personel are now|     prisoners of the Federation.
Argent:|     Incoming transmission, sir.
Albid:|     Baker 16, this is Willy 16.
Ceruleo:|     This is Baker 16.
Albid:|     Ken, is everything alright?
Ceruleo:|     Yes, sir. We made contact with the enemy.|     They knew our shield frequencies.
Albid:|     So they do. Send a sit-rep when you can.
Ceruleo:|     Roger, sir.
Albid:|     Kenneth, is there something on your mind?
Ceruleo:|     Yes. I have a bad feeling about this conflict.|     Every time we come close to finishing the|     rebels they bounce back like this.
Albid:|     Don't think too much of it.|     Many wars go like this.
Ceruleo:|     Yes, sir.
Albid:|     Well, good luck. Charlie-Mike.|     Willy 16-out.
Argent:|     Sir, I have that sit-rep.
Ceruleo:|     Thanks. Charlie-Mike, right?
Argent:|     Yeah, Ken. Continue your mission.
