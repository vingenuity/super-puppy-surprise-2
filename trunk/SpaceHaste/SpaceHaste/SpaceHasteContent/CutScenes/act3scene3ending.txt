Albid:|     Is this defeat? I don't believe it!
George Door:|     Curse you, Blau!
George Door:|     Curse you, Katie, you traitor! 
George Door:|     Curse you, Ceruleo!
Ceruleo:|     Finally, we can have peace...
After George Door the traitor was captured,
 Ceruleo went back to his post,|     where he kept his self-promotion. 
Katie restored Apfel to honesty|     and brought an end to the conflict. 
Blau went to be a politician|     and good friend to Kenneth Ceruleo.|     He always wanted a greater punishment for|     George Door, but Ceruleo demanded he only|     be imprisoned for life. 
He knew George's rotten heart|     was far worse than anything the |     Federation could do. 
Under the leadership of Katie, Blau and Ceruleo,|     the ferderation and rebels came to establish a|     long lasting peace.
